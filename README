The testTemperatureMultipleSensors.

Define a table with DeviceAddresses of the sensors. This table is the initial table.

At setup, this table will be copied to EEPROM. The onewire bus is scanned and unknown
devices (that do not appear in the initial table) are added to the EEPROM table.

This static table is used to guarantee a fixed sequence.
The EEPROM table makes it possible to have "unregistered" sensors added,
but they will appear with a random "index" in the table.
